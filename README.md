Hi, I’m Johann J/van Vuuren (@TechnoMageKOMT) and I live in Johannesburg, South Africa.  

I’m interested in web and web application developement as well as mobile application developemnt.  

My current study areas are HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, but I will soon start with Python and some PHP as well; and would eventually like to add Java to my skill set as well. Coding is not entirely new to me. I have done some explorations of C, C++ and Python in the past.  

I would love to collaborate on some projects, but I think I am too inexperienced at this stage to contribute in a meaningful manner.  

My academic background is scientific (Chemistry and Biochemistry), but I have decided to pursue a career in web development to work from home in a freelance capacity (initially), and to satisfy a life-long desire to work in software development. I have been working in clinical laboratory 
medicine up until now and have had to master numerous different software systems related to this specialisation which strengthend my already established interest in computer coding.

The conventional working environment does not really suite my personality and I have finally gathered enough life savings to resign from my normal employment to pursue this new path fulltime.

I, therefore have a very steep learning curve and limited time to get to a level of skill where I can start making some money.

Wish me luck and please feel free to contact me at technomagekomt@gmail.com. It would be very cool to get an informal mentor to accompany me on this learning curve.
